## ✨ Core Features

### 🧩 Multi-Mechanic Puzzle Experience
Every floor introduces a new mechanic:
- 🔺 **Level 1:** Laser & mirror reflection

- 🤖 **Level 4:** Body-switch maze (Human ↔ Drone) with box pushing & hazards  
- 🧟 **Level 5:** Enemy combat + binary-search scanner + trap assembly  

### 🔦 Immersive Horror Environment
- Third-person perspective for cinematic storytelling  
- Gradual lighting shift from **cold blue → sickly green** as danger increases

- Hidden narrative clues across all levels  

### 🧪 Narrative-Driven Progression
Find out:
- What the researchers were experimenting on  
- Why the test subjects mutated

- Why your contractor *really* sent you  

Collect **4 Lure Components** (one per level), then assemble them in Level 5.

### 🧟 Escape-Room × Boss Encounter Hybrid
