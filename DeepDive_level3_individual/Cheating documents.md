# 🎨 Second Room – Color Sequence Memory Puzzle

  1. Interact with the door lock  
  2. Click **“Finish”**  
  3. Observe the display again  

### 🎨 Fixed Color Sequences

3. **Red, Blue, Yellow, Red**  
4. **Yellow, Blue, Red, Yellow, Blue**  
5. **Blue, Red, Yellow, Blue, Yellow, Red**

# 🚨 Third Room – Trap Floor Path Puzzle

The third room contains a **12 × 12 tile floor**.  
Players must walk along the **correct path**, revealed briefly by a spotlight.

### 🔦 How it works:
1. The correct path lights up for **1 second**.  
2. After that, the player may walk on the tiles.  
3. If the player steps on **any incorrect tile**, they must **restart the puzzle**.

### 🎲 Path Randomization
- The correct path is **randomly generated each attempt**.  
- Therefore, **no fixed answer** exists.

### 📸 Recommended Strategy
Players may take a **photo with their phone** during the 1-second reveal to memorize the correct route.

### 🚪 Room Exit
After successfully walking the correct path:
- The door to **Level 4** will open automatically.
- **Note:** The individual build in this document **does NOT contain Level 4**.
- In the **group build**, players access Level 4 through the elevator in this room.
